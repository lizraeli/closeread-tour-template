Midtown Manhattan is one of the city’s core locations, where commuters pour through vast stations, theaters light up the night, and skyscrapers trace the city’s silhouette. @cr-midtown-map

Times Square evolved from Longacre Square into a global commercial intersection after the New York Times moved here in 1904.  @cr-times-square-historic

Today, the area glows with neon lights, digital billboards, and crowds from around the world, making it one of the most photographed places on Earth. @cr-times-square-today

Opened in 1911, the library’s Beaux-Arts façade and vast Rose Main Reading Room are symbols of public learning on a grand scale. @cr-nypl-exterior

The Main Reading Room is furnished with low wooden tables and chairs. There are two arrays of tables in each hall, separated by a wide aisle; each table has four brass lamps. @cr-nypl-reading-room

Surrounding the room are thousands of reference works, which may be taken off the open shelves along the room's main and balcony levels.

Grand Central (1913) combines engineering, transit, and civic grandeur. The ceiling traces a reversed map of the constellations. @cr-gct-constellation


The terminal’s concourse, with its constant motion of travelers and echoing announcements, captures the rhythm of the city itself. @cr-gct-concourse

Midtown is both a crossroads and a showcase of the city’s ambition, where historic architecture and modern life continually intersect. @cr-outro-street
