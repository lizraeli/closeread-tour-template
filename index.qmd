Times Square evolved from Longacre Square into a global marquee after the New York Times moved here in 1904.  @cr-times-square-historic

The square’s layered signage and pedestrian plazas make it a quintessential Midtown location.

_Tip for your tour:_ pair historic images with a contemporary view to show change over time. @cr-times-square-today

Opened in 1911, the library’s Beaux-Arts façade and vast Rose Main Reading Room symbolize public learning at scale. @cr-nypl-exterior

The Main Reading Room is furnished with low wooden tables and chairs. There are two arrays of tables in each hall, separated by a wide aisle; each table has four brass lamps. @cr-nypl-reading-room

Surrounding the room are thousands of reference works, which may be taken off the open shelves along the room's main and balcony levels.

Grand Central (1913) combines engineering, transit, and civic grandeur. A close-up panel can spotlight the ceiling’s reversed zodiac constellations. @cr-gct-constellation

Another can anchor the sense of place with the bustling concourse. @cr-gct-concourse
